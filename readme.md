# ToolShare

## Project Idea
ToolShare is a university-wide equipment sharing platform that connects students and staff with underutilized tools and equipment across campus, making specialized resources accessible for academic projects and research.

## Project Background / Business Opportunity

There are multiple reasons why we are doing this. The first one is that universities often have equipment that students need access to, but there is not a simple method of scheduling the use of equipment, or to borrow it. There is also the issue that students are not always aware of what equipment is available. If equipment is listed in one centralized place, it will be much easier for students to see what equipment they could potentially have access to. Additionally, universities are struggling for money. If they were able to give students more efficient access to the equipment they already own, it could cut down on the costs of buying additional equipment.

The way we are going to solve this is by allowing faculty members to list equipment that they are willing to allow students to borrow/book (depending on if it can be reasonably taken out of the building or not). Students can then look through the available equipment to see if there is something they need, and then book a time that it is available. Additionally, faculty may decide if students will need training before using certain equipment, and include checks for ensuring students applying to use it are qualified.

The types of equipment that would be available could range from oscilloscopes, to art supplies and anything in-between. Anything that students could need to schedule and/or borrow could be included. Obscure items that students may not even know exist could be put up, giving students access to a greater catalogue while also saving the costs of buying them new.
