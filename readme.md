# ToolShare 

## Overview
**ToolShare** is a university-wide equipment sharing platform designed to help students and staff efficiently discover, book, and manage access to underutilized tools and equipment across campus. The platform centralizes equipment availability, streamlines booking workflows, and improves accountability while reducing unnecessary equipment purchases.

---

## Problem Statement
Universities often own a wide range of specialized equipment that is:
- Difficult for students to discover
- Managed through manual or fragmented booking processes
- Underutilized due to lack of visibility and coordination

At the same time, students frequently purchase or request new equipment simply because they are unaware that suitable tools already exist on campus. This leads to inefficiencies, increased costs, and missed learning opportunities.

---

## Solution
ToolShare addresses these challenges by providing:
- A **centralized catalog** of university-owned equipment
- A **secure booking and approval workflow**
- Role-based access for students, faculty, lab managers, and administrators
- Clear visibility into availability, usage, and accountability

Faculty and staff can list equipment they are willing to share, while students can browse, request, and track access to equipment needed for coursework, research, and personal projects.
